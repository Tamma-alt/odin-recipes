      <h4>extra intructions</h4>

      <li>
        The white rice should be cooked tender but still firm to bite (like you
        cook your pasta al-dente). Overcooking the rice will result in mushy
        fried rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t
        overcook your veggies.
      </li>
      <li>
        You need to increase the heat and stir continuously to get that nice
        coveted crisp during frying.
